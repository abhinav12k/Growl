Must have encountered some dog on roadside yelling in pain but you find yourself so helpless to help that dog because of either the lack of awareness what to do next or could not find a help that can really help u in this aspect.
What can we do to help these animals? 
We have developed an app that is used to accomplish the task.
The App named Growl helps the users as well as the growlers.
